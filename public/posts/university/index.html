      You may indeed have a few questions coming into this post, and rest
      assured I'll try my best to answer as many of them as I can; note,
      however, that this post is less a guide on how to do what I did and more
      of a retrospective, and perhaps a heads-up for those who may be planning
      to do something similar for themselves. I don't believe that any
      particular path of education is &ldquo;better&rdquo; than any other.
